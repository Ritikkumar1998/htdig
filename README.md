## Note from Andy Alt

2017-11-06

I may work on the project from time to time. The original developers have
abandoned it.

Any one interested in the project can join the
[chat room](https://join.slack.com/t/htdig/shared_invite/enQtMjY3NDU1MjMwODk3LTdmM2I2OWI5NWI4MzU4Y2JmMjk2MzAxNDYzM2IzZjJmMGE2MDZmMWMxNDY3MjAwOGFjMmE1YjM2MmM4MzVkNzk)

I'm leaving the original README below unaltered.
